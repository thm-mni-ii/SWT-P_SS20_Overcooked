# SS20_Overcooked
Welcome to Underconnected.
We have developed the chemistry learning game "Underconnected" for the Software Engineering Project (Softwaretechnik-Projekt) in the summer term 2020 at the [Technical University of Central Hesse (Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen)](https://www.thm.de/site/).

You can find more about the game by heading over to our [wiki](https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/SWT-P_SS20_Overcooked/wiki), which is currently only available in german.

We used the [Unity-Engine](https://unity.com/) to create this game, this was a requirement and not an active choice on our part.

The code documentation can be found [here](https://thm-mni-ii.github.io/SWT-P_SS20_Overcooked/). It was created using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
