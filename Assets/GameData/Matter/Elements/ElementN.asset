  name: Nitrogen
  description: "itrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number
    7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford
    in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently
    done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because
    his work was published first. The name nitrog\xE8ne was suggested by French chemist
    Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present
    in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote,
    from the Greek \u1F00\u03B6\u03C9\u03C4\u03B9\u03BA\u03CC\u03C2 \"no life\",
    as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is instead used in many languages, such
    as French, Italian, Russian, Romanian and Turkish, and appears in the English
    names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds."
