  description: Uric acid is a heterocyclic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
    and hydrogen with the formula C5H4N4O3. It forms ions and salts known as urates
    and acid urates, such as ammonium acid urate. Uric acid is a product of the metabolic
    breakdown of purine nucleotides, and it is a normal component of urine. High
    blood concentrations of uric acid can lead to gout and are associated with other
    medical conditions, including diabetes and the formation of ammonium acid urate
    kidney stones.
