  name: Acetic acid
  description: "Acetic acid /\u0259\u02C8si\u02D0t\u026Ak/, systematically named
    ethanoic acid /\u02CC\u025B\u03B8\u0259\u02C8no\u028A\u026Ak/, is a colourless
    liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H,
    C2H4O2, or HC2H3O2). When undiluted, it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid.
    Vinegar is no less than 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main
    component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste
    and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as
    a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a
    weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic
    acid is corrosive and can attack the skin."
